### FIRST
There are to subprojects __frontend__  and __api__, so you should
go into each of them (```cd frontend``` or ```cd api``` respectivly) and perform ```npm install``` !!! not in root __travel-app__ folder !!!

### FOR API CONNECTION
* Go to __travel-app__ folder
* Start server in the 1st terminal: ```cd api && npm run start:dev```  
* Start app in the 2nd terminal: ```cd frontend && npm start```
* Enjoy!
